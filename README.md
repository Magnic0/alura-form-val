# Form Validation with JavaScript and HTML

This repo was created with the intention to learn (and only learn), about Form Validation. Not all files in the project are made by me, the most part of is was provided by one of the [Alura's](https://alura.com.br/) courses, to guide and fasten the process of learning. 

If you wanna fork it and make your own changes, be free to do it! I'll be realy happy.

If you want to see it working, there's a [Github Pages section](https://magnic0.github.io/alura-form-val/) I've created just for this.
